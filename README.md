The repository [https://github.com/BondMachineHQ/bmexamples](https://github.com/BondMachineHQ/bmexamples) is the main source of examples for the BondMachine project. The examples are organized according to the following logic:

Examples from 00 to 17 are the examples created for the [ICSC Course: Introductory course to HLS FPGA programming](https://agenda.infn.it/event/38191/) and are described in the [slides](https://www.bondmachine.it/docs/slides/icsc2023/) of the course.

All other examples are named by the scheme boardname_examplename, where boardname is the name of the board and examplename is the name of the example.
