The repository [https://github.com/BondMachineHQ/bmexamples](https://github.com/BondMachineHQ/bmexamples) is the main source of examples for the BondMachine project. The examples are organized according to the following logic:

Examples from 00 to 17 are the examples created for the [ICSC Course: Introductory course to HLS FPGA programming](https://agenda.infn.it/event/38191/) and are described in the [slides](https://www.bondmachine.it/docs/slides/icsc2023/) of the course.

Examples the start with the name `regr` are regression tests for the BondMachine project. They are used to verify the correct behavior of the BondMachine project.
They can also be read as examples of how to use specific features of the BondMachine project. The documentation of these examples is minimal, as they are intended for developers who are already familiar with the BondMachine project.

All other examples are named by the scheme boardname_examplename, where boardname is the name of the board and examplename is the name of the example. Each example has a README.md file that describes the example and how to run it.
