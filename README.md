# BondMachine Examples

The repository [https://github.com/BondMachineHQ/bmexamples](https://github.com/BondMachineHQ/bmexamples) is the main source of examples for the BondMachine project. The examples are organized according to the following logic:

The 00Courses directory contains examples created for specific courses or tutorials. Each course has its own subdirectory, which contains the examples for that course. For example, the ICSC2023 directory contains examples for the [ICSC Course: Introductory course to HLS FPGA programming](https://agenda.infn.it/event/38191/) whose slides are available [here](https://www.bondmachine.it/docs/slides/icsc2023/).

The 00Regression directory contains regression tests for the BondMachine project. These tests are used to verify the correct behavior of the BondMachine project.
Thay can also be read as examples of how to use specific features of the BondMachine project but are intended for developers who are already familiar with the BondMachine project and lack extensive documentation.

All other examples are named by the scheme boardname_examplename, where boardname is the name of the board and examplename is the name of the example. Each example has a README.md file that describes the example and how to run it. These examples are intended to showcase the capabilities of the BondMachine project and provide users with a starting point for their own projects.
